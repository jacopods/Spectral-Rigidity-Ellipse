# Spectral-rigidity-ellipse

We use the scripts contained herein to provide numerical evidence for dynamical spectral rigidity among ellipses of
various eccentricities. The code contained in these scripts follows the technique implemented in a paper by J. De Simoi, V. Kaloshin and Q. Wei (a link to the paper is here: [Dynamical_Spectral_Rigidity](https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2017/186-1/p07)).  
There are 3 scripts:
1. `e_and_semi_axes_file.py`
2. `Col_pts_find.py`
3. `Spectral_rigidity_script.py`
